    <h2>One-On-One Online Tarot Course</h2>
    <h3>Live with the Spiritual Hobo</h3>
    <p>
        You will also be eligible for full membership in The Tarot Readers Union, 
        which is a unified group of Tarot Card Readers that were students of this course. 
        This membership is free and optional for you. You will receive over 30 of my Tarot 
        charts, graphs, and documents and a signed copy of my book PENIEL. The charts, etc., 
        were produced specifically to highlight unobvious patterns and systems within the Tarot Cards. 
        These original charts make memorizing the Tarot Card meanings easy. The course consists of 
        30 classes that last about two hours each. The classes are one-on-one and usually conducted 
        using FaceTime by phone, but options are available. A student could complete the course in 
        a month's time by scheduling a class a day for 30 days, but most take longer to conclude. 
        We go at your pace. Classes are scheduled a day in advance by you unless a consistent 
        schedule is developed. In other words, you have a lot of flexibility with regards to your attendance. 
        My experience and skill as "the educator" are your assurance that I know how to teach you everything 
        about Tarot and Tarot Cards and Reading Tarot Cards in a fun and easy way. The total cost of the 
        course (for now) is $500 (this is half price), so consider that. Payment is made through my secure 
        online paysite, which I link you to when you decide to enroll. Paying in installments is considered 
        if needed. The purpose of this school is not money, but money is needed to provide the service. 
        What is most considerable is your enthusiasm for finding this particular school. You are reading 
        this for a reason; nothing happens by accident. When the student is ready, the teacher appears. 
        Welcome to class! Below is a list of some of the course curriculum, but be sure that no stone is 
        left unturned in the field of understanding that you will now be working in. My guarantee is that 
        you will be a highly-skilled, professional Tarot Card Reader after completing the course. You will 
        absolutely read Tarot Cards with total clarity. You will help others and be confident charging and 
        receiving compensation for your services. Here is a link to the Tarot deck you will need for this course:
